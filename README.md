# Quantum Optical Circuits with Perceval

This jupyter notebook is a supplementary resource to the authorâ€™s preprint paper  _Photonic Quantum Computing: An Overview_. This paper aims to serve as a starting point for the reader interested in learning the fundamentals of photonic quantum computing. We cover fundamental quantum principles, mathematical foundations, hardware and software tools for programming photonic quantum circuits, and resources for further study.

The notebook has the following sections:
  
   1. Quandela Cloud account
   
   2. Unitary matrices and Optical Circuits
   
       2.1. Run on a quantum simulator
       2.2. Run on a real quantum processor
       
   3. Optical Circuit from Gate Circuit


## Installation



Install requirements locally (ideally, in a virtual environment):

    pip install -r requirements.txt



To run the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```
